    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>

    <p>This is a webpage about one of the sportsball organizations that the
      University of Colorado exploits for the purpose of advertising its campus
      to potential student recruits from out of state. Since out of state studets
      are required to pay higher tuition, the administartion (as well as the
      administrations of many other state schools) has long ago determined
      that maximizing out of state students is the ideal way to grow the
      Univeristiy. This particular varient of sportsball is
      very popular in the USA, in fact, some people consider it
      to be the de facto national religion. Clearly, this is the ideal
      children's game to bolster recruitment numbers!
      Here is a link to the official website of the
      <!--Note: target="_blank" -> always open links in new tabs/windows -->
      <a href="https://cubuffs.com/" target="_blank">CU Buffs</a>,
      which I think is short for
      Buffalo, a type of North American land mammal that used to exist in Boulder
      but had to be forcefully removed from the area before construction crews
      could break ground on Old Main in 1876.
